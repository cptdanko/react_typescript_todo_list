# React todo list using Typescript and Yarn

I had never used the yarn package manager before so thought I would give it a try and see what it is like. This is a simple react app built with typescript using the yarn package manager. 

I aim to make this a living repository, in the sense that things can be added to this repo to demostrate certain react concepts. You can read my original post on this [repo over here].

## This repository ...
- shows a todo list app built with react and Typescript
- uses Google Oauth for authorisation
- performs all CRUD operations
- uses MUI to style components
- uses localStorage to save data
- uses yarn as a package manager

This app has also been deployed and served via AWS S3 and CloudFront. [Click the CloudFront link] to check it in your browser.

# How to enable Google Auth
To use Google Authentication via OAuth you need to copy the client id for your app from the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) dashboard.
