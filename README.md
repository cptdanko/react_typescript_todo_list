# React todo list using Typescript and Yarn

I had never used the yarn package manager before so thought I would give it a try and see what it is like. This is a simple react app built with typescript using the yarn package manager. 

I will be writing a [blogpost] (https://mydaytodo.com/blog/) about my thoughts on building a react app with yarn soon.

## This repository has ...
- a todo list app built with react 
- built using Typescript 
- has all the CRUD operations
- uses localStorage to save data
- uses yarn as a package manager
